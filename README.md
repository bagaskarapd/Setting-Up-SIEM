<h1>Project: Setting Up a SIEM for Threat Detection</h1>
<p>
  As an Informatics Engineering graduate aspiring to become a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, I created this project to demonstrate my ability to deploy and utilize a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. This hands-on lab walks through the process of setting up Splunk to monitor, analyze, and detect security threats in real-time.
</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<ul>
  <li>install and configure Splunk</li>
  <li>collect security logs from systems and analyze real-time threats</li>
  <li>create alerts for suspicious activity (failed logins, brute-force attempts, unusual network behavior)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Splunk</strong> – to analyze related logs.</li>
  <li><strong>Virtual Machine(Windows10pro)</strong>

<h2>Step 1: Choosing SIEM Tool</h2>
<p>There are several SIEMs out there, but i focus on Splunk (free version) for this lab.</p>
