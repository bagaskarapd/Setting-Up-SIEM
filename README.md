<h1>Project: Setting Up a SIEM for Threat Detection</h1>
<p>
  As an Informatics Engineering graduate aspiring to become a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, I created this project to demonstrate my ability to deploy and utilize a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. This hands-on lab walks through the process of setting up Splunk to monitor, analyze, and detect security threats in real-time.
</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<ul>
  <li>install and configure Splunk</li>
  <li>collect security logs from systems and analyze real-time threats</li>
  <li>create alerts for suspicious activity (failed logins, brute-force attempts, unusual network behavior)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Splunk</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Virtual Machine(Windows10pro)</strong></li>

<h2>Step 1: Choosing SIEM Tool</h2>
<p>There are several SIEMs out there, but i focus on Splunk (free version) for this lab.
  Splunk is a powerful and widely used SIEM tool. I used the Free Edition, which is sufficient for lab and training purposes.

<h2>Step 2: Install and Configure Splunk</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Installing Splunk on local machine or a virtual machine (VM).</li>
  <li>Open Splunk Web Interface (Default: http://localhost:8000).</li>
  <li>Create an admin account and log in.</li>
  <li>Adding first data source: Windows Event Logs or Linux Syslogs.</li>
</ol>
